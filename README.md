# Spaceball Aerotrim Device

Code for the Spaceball Microcontroller (ESP32) - To use with VIRTUAL REALITY TRUNK MUSCLE TRAINING SYSTEM Biomedical Capstone Project

## Purpose
The Spaceball is an apparatus that mimics a sphere where a person will be seated in a chair placed in the middle. The Spaceball moves in two degrees of freedom, pitch and roll. The pitch rotates such that the patient turns forward and backwards. The roll direction rotates the user side to side. Refer to the picture below of the apparatus in the appendix for a visual representation. In this design the Spaceball is to be used as the seated apparatus for the seated patient. The patient will use this for training the trunk muscles. The Spaceball will move in both the pitch and roll direction as the rehabilitation engineer or clinician decides when applying the training program. This will have the patient adjust to the movements and activate their trunk muscles in order to train and strengthen the muscles.
